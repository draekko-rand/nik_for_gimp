### Notes:

* Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with Wine Staging v7.11 using Nik Collection v1.2.11, and GIMP v2.99 (from git).
* You can use an already downloadeded nikcollection-1.2.11.exe file with the installation script but make sure to use the absolute path when doing so.
* Depending on your system specs the plugins can take some time to start as they are launched through wine.
